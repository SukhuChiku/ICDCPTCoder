AI-assisted CPT/ICD-10 coder that converts doctor notes into structured billing code suggestions while prioritizing patient privacy
In healthcare or health tech, you know the real concern isn’t just model accuracy, it’s protecting patient data.
I recently built an 𝐀𝐈-𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐏𝐓/𝐈𝐂𝐃-10 𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐫 that converts doctor notes into structured billing code suggestions while prioritizing patient privacy.

🔑 Key work:
• Designed a 𝐭𝐰𝐨-𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐇𝐈 𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 using 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐞𝐱 + 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐨𝐟𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐝𝐢𝐨  (𝐍𝐋𝐏-based entity detection) before any external AI inference

• Integrated 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐀𝐈 to generate CPT/ICD suggestions from redacted clinical text

• Built backend services using .𝐍𝐄𝐓 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐏𝐈𝐬 + 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐒𝐐𝐋, containerized with Docker, and deployed on a small 𝐀𝐖𝐒 𝐄𝐂2 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞

• Focused on a 𝐇𝐈𝐏𝐀𝐀 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐜𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧, treating AI as assistive tooling where humans remain in the loop
